## About

simOn, a memory game, is a version of Simon Says. At the start of each round, Simon will present a randomized sequence of colors before the player's turn. If the player can successfully repeat the sequence, they will move on to the next round. After each round, Simon's sequence length will increase. To win, the player must complete all rounds.
